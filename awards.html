Our most recent award, we received the Crymble award as part of a world class energy to defend our home planet. Among other interplanetary travel agencies, we were made aware of a threat to Earth's living creatures in the year 2050. We, with the help of several interns + software developers, were able to eradicate the threat 100%. We were awarded the Crymble award for our best in class innovation towards the safety of Earth and its inhabitants.

Often known as the "hardest to be found" award, the Loch Ness award is given to companies with spacecrafts of stunning design. These spacecrafts typically follow a few rules, including incredibly quiet design. Spacecrafts that are incredibly quiet and actively working to reduce noise pollution within our communities are known as Loch Ness spacecrafts. Every year a winner is determined, the quietest spacecraft. In 1998, we were honored to be declared the Loch Ness spacecraft.

In 1963, as a new startup company, we received a blue ribbon in trying. This blue ribbon is awarded yearly to startup companies with five years or less operating. We received the blue ribbon for our innovative ideas and designs. The year 1963 was when we decided we were ready to begin operation on our moon landing resorts.
